Small project to test the skeleton for "polyset"

Core take-aways:
- Make SAB and STB final
- Use dynamic casting for set ctor and dtor
- For constructors: Call all base constructors.
- For destructors: Call nothing.
- Both also work automatically.

Order in exam:
- Add SAB
	- class
	- has()
- Add STB
	- class
	- has()
- Add Set
	- class
	- dynamic cast ctor
	- dynamic cast dtor
	- functions
- Add canonical form if necessary
	- SAB
	- STB
	- Set
