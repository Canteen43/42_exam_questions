# 42 Exam Questions

A collection of 42 school exam exercises including ft_popen, polyset, sandbox, vect2, and mini_serv.

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions to various 42 school exam questions covering fundamental programming concepts.
The exercises come with strict requirements. Functions that would make the exercise "easy" are mostly forbidden.
The exact wording of the exercises is not included because they are long and only available during exams where copying them is not allowed.

## Exercises

### ft_popen
Recoding the popen() C function

### polyset
C++ inheritance implementation

### sandbox
Function testing framework

### vect2
C++ operator overloading for 2D vector class

### mini_serv
Minimal Server in C

## Compilation

Each exercise must be compiled individually. Some might still need main functions.
